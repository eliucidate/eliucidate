               <h3>about me</h3>
               <p>I'm a student at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a> studying Applied Math-Computer Science. My technical interests are multifarious-I'm passionate
                  about data science and machine learning, though that doesn't preclude my interest in back-end database topics, nor an emerging curiousity for security and computational biology.
               </p>
               <p>I fervently believe that the best developers are cognizant of class and racial inequity, and attempt to address key disparities in accessibility and representation. 
                  To this end, a number of my projects are aimed at addressing healthcare disparities. I'm also involved in a number of diversity and mental-health campus initiatives.

                     <p>Air pollution is a big problem in many areas, so we sought to better characterize the behavior of quantifiable air pollution. We investigated the 
                        effect of weather on the amount of different fine particulate pollutants in the atmosphere. We used the body of air quality data from OpenAQ, cleaned it, 
                        and paired it with historical weather data. We trained different machine learning classifiers to ultimately predict air quality changes with over 70% accuracy. We used
                        Python for cleaning the data and for the machine learning.

                     <p>Autism spectrum disorders are chronically underdiagnosed in low-income communities. We wanted to address this issue by using different biomarkers to 
                        screen for traits which suggest that a child may be affected by autism. Our efforts were concentrated in two different areas: prosody and facial features.
                        We constructed a model for facial features from a suite of test images scraped from Google Images for 3-5 yr. old boys using the Microsoft Azure Face API. For prosody, we used a suite of videos
                        from Youtube for 3-5 yr. old boys, and constructed classifiers for processed audio data. Javascript was used for the facial biomarkers, and a combination of Python, R, and Matlab were used to
                        analyze prosody.

                     <p>Decide is a mobile application built using the Ionic framework, with Node.js / MongoDB used for the backend. It allows people to send out polls so that other people can vote on the choices. The voting mechanism is designed to be fun - people swipe left or right to vote.
                        The results are gathered and displayed for whomever created the original poll.

                     <p>dHOPE engages users by keeping track of their DPP (Drain Protection Points) in order to incentivize community members to take initiative in taking care of their local drains. Because these regions often lack the infrastructure to maintain up to date databases for municipal drainage systems, we used a crowdsourcing solution to identify the drains. In order to engage the community with the idea of protecting their local drains, we designed dHOPE to be a fun, interactive experience. Members of the community are awarded points for identifying, confirming, and adopting drains, and a local leaderboard tracks those who contribute the most to the community. In order to provide additional functionality, we also added additional features of a color-coded system and a weather panel to warn of imminent rainfall.
                        dHOPE is built using meteor.js in conjunction with Javascript and HTML. We integrated multiple functionalities, with a MongoDB backend database used to store user and drain information. We implemented the Google Maps API in order to visualize our content and provide interactivity.

                     <p>fanyi began as a one-off side project to translate a Chinese web novel to English. After drawing a fair amount of traffic, fanyi was acquired by a larger 
                        aggregate-volare novels. Weekly releases and other administrative tasks give me a chance to hone my Chinese (casual and professional) while steadily generating revenue.

                     <p>As a first foray in the digital humanities, I was interested in examining so called 'hysteric' literature and seeing what characterized the novels
					 and the characters as hysterics. Using Python and the Natural Language Processing Toolkit, I constructed ML classifiers on writing style and n-grams
					 to find out just what made the female character be seen as a hysteric.</p>
